# Markdown, a Summary
My summary of markdown

Markdown is the interface used by [Github](https://github.com/) to create webpages. It is an inbetween pure HTML coding and a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) such as Wordpress or other CMSes.

One of the benefits of Markdown are a more accessible interface than HTML while offering more control than a WYSIWYG. The biggest downside is having to learn a new process that isn't directly transferable to HTML coding or more common CMSes.
